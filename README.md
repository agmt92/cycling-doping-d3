## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a visual representation of doping in professional bicycle racing. It uses D3.js to create an interactive scatter plot that displays the fastest times up Alpe d'Huez, highlighting whether or not the cyclist was involved in doping.

## Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Hover over data points to see detailed information about each cyclist.
- **Tooltip**: Displays additional information about the cyclist when hovering over a data point.
- **Axes**: X-axis represents the year, and Y-axis represents the time in minutes.
- **Styling**: Custom styles and inner shadow effects for text elements.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: For creating the interactive scatter plot.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For data manipulation and D3.js integration.
- **Bootstrap**: For basic styling and layout.
